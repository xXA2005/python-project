# Resume Analyzer with Job Matching - Project Report

## 1. Introduction
This project implements a Resume Analyzer with Job Matching system for the CECS-218 final project. The application processes resumes in TXT, PDF, or DOCX formats, extracts key information (name, email, skills), and matches skills with job profiles using cosine similarity. A Flask-based web API allows users to upload resumes and view results via a web interface. The project leverages object-oriented programming (OOP), regular expressions, exception handling, and machine learning techniques.

## 2. Approach
The project consists of two core modules and a web API:
- **ResumeReader**: Extracts name, email, and skills from TXT, PDF, or DOCX files using regex.
- **SkillMatcher**: Matches extracted skills with job profiles using TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity.
- **Flask API**: Provides a web interface and API endpoint for uploading resumes and retrieving results.

### Technologies Used
- Python 3.8+
- Libraries: re, os, scikit-learn, PyPDF2, python-docx, Flask
- Design Patterns: OOP (Encapsulation, Single Responsibility Principle)
- Exception Handling: FileNotFoundError, ValueError, general exceptions
- Version Control: Git

## 3. Implementation Details
### ResumeReader
- Supports TXT, PDF (via PyPDF2), and DOCX (via python-docx) files.
- Uses regex to extract:
  - Name (first non-empty line or first line)
  - Email (standard email format)
  - Skills (predefined list: Python, SQL, etc.)
- Handles file not found, unsupported formats, and extraction errors.

### SkillMatcher
- Maintains a static dictionary of job profiles (Software Engineer, Data Scientist, Project Manager).
- Uses scikit-learn's TfidfVectorizer to convert skills to TF-IDF vectors.
- Computes cosine similarity between candidate and job profile skills.
- Returns match percentages for each job role.

### Flask API
- Endpoint: `/api/upload` (POST) accepts file uploads.
- Web interface at `/` allows file selection and displays results.
- Handles file validation and errors gracefully.

## 4. Challenges
- **File Parsing**: Ensuring compatibility with varied PDF and DOCX formats required robust error handling.
- **Regex Accuracy**: Extracting information from unstructured resumes was challenging; we assumed a simplified structure.
- **Flask Integration**: Securing file uploads and managing temporary files added complexity.
- **Skill Matching**: Normalizing skills for accurate cosine similarity required careful preprocessing.

## 5. Screenshots
*(Include screenshots of the web interface, console output, and sample API responses.)*

## 6. Outputs
For a sample PDF resume with skills "Python, SQL, Machine Learning, Teamwork":
- Extracted: Name (John Doe), Email (john.doe@example.com), Skills (Python, SQL, Machine Learning, Teamwork)
- Match Results:
  - Software Engineer: 72.3% match
  - Data Scientist: 89.1% match
  - Project Manager: 45.6% match
- API Response: JSON object with name, email, skills, and job matches.

## 7. Conclusion
The project successfully implements resume parsing and job matching with support for multiple file formats and a user-friendly web API. Future enhancements could include:
- Advanced NLP for skill extraction.
- Support for additional file formats.
- User authentication for the API.
